German-Dictionary

A program that allows you to keep a list of English words and their German translations along with the gender of the German word, the plural form, and the function that the word has in a sentence (noun, pronoun, article, verb, adverb, adjective, etc.)

Hopeful future abilites of this program include the ability to conjugate German verbs and, given the case and gender of a phrase, be able to give the proper endings. Another functionality will be creating more than one dictionary at a time.

An untested issue might be including words with special characters (ä, ß, ü, etc.)
